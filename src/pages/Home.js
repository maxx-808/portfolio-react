          Currently enrolled in a full stack coding bootcamp from UC Berkeley
          Extension. This class is set to end on March 27, 2021 and I started
          during the ending of September 2020. Through doing this class I have
          learned a lot about web development and coding as a whole. My goal
          with this class is to learn about the coding world and start my
          journey through a career with computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, I have learned a myriad of skills for web development based on
          JavaScript. Mostly sticking to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; we have
          expanded into their libraries and attached programs and styles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Some things I have learned so far:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
          <li>CSS libraries like bootstrap and materialize</li>
          <li>
            JavaScript necessities like jQuery, API calls, JSX, and localStorage
          </li>
          <li>Ways of coding like MVC, CRUD functionality, and MERN stack</li>
          <li>
            Databases like MySQL and MongoDB as well as integrating them to be
            used in apps
          </li>
          <li>
            Node.js: using inquirer, express, Sequelize, React and much more
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before this class, I had no experience in coding. For this class I had
          some prework to do and i got a free online intro course into coding.
          Other than that, I was working at a movie theater since the middle of
          highschool. I went up from doing cashier and cleaning work to becoming
          an assistant manager doing tasks like inventory, logging info in excel
          sheets, and much more. I've had quite the diverse work history working
          there and it has helped me to have a good work ethic during the class
          I am currently in.
